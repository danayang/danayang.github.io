I am a postdoc at the Fuqua school of Business, Duke University working with [Prof. Jiaming Xu](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jx77/). In 2019 I received my PhD degree from the department of statistics and data science at Yale University. At Yale I was co-advised by [Prof. David Pollard](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~pollard/), [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/), and [Prof. John Lafferty](https://statml.yale.edu/people/pi).

I am spending Fall 2021 at Simons Institute for the Theory of computing, UC Berkeley on a Simons-Berkeley research fellowship. I will be participating in the program [Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021).

I am very excited to join Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science as an Assistant Professor Spring 2022!

* rapid mixing of Markov chains
* recovery of hidden structures from random networks
* fairness in machine learning
* analysis of aggregation estimators
* convergence guarantee of the EM algorithm
* shape-constrained nonparametric estimation
* private sequential learning
